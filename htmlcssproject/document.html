They might use tests like X-rays or blood tests to understand what's going on inside the body, and then they use medicine, surgery, or other treatments to help fix the problem.</p></li>
					<li><h4>Recommendation Systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon):</h4><p>Recommendation Systems are like helpful guides that suggest things you might like based on what you've enjoyed before. They use smart computer programs to look at what movies, shows, or products you've watched or bought in the past, and then they suggest new ones that you might enjoy. Examples include when Netflix suggests movies or shows to watch, or when Amazon recommends products to buy.</p></li>
					<li><h4>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</h4><p>Natural Language Processing is like teaching computers to understand and use human language, such as English or Spanish. It's a technology that helps computers read, understand, and generate text like a person would. NLP is used in things like voice assistants, translation apps, and spam filters to make them smarter and more useful</p></li>
					<li><h4>Computer Vision:</h4><p>Computer Vision is like giving computers the ability to see and understand the world around them, just like humans do with their eyes. It's a technology that helps computers recognize and interpret images and videos. Computer vision is used in things like facial recognition, self-driving cars, and quality control in manufacturing to help computers make sense of visual information.</p></li>
					<li><h4>Robotics:</h4><p>Robotics is like creating smart machines that can move and do tasks on their own. These machines, called robots, use technology like sensors and computer programs to sense their environment, make decisions, and perform actions. Robotics is used in many areas like manufacturing, healthcare, and exploration to automate tasks and make them safer and more efficient</p></li>
					<li><h4>Financial Trading:</h4><p>Financial Trading is like buying and selling things like stocks, currencies, or commodities to make money. People and companies do this using financial markets, where they trade these assets. They use analysis, strategies, and sometimes computer programs to decide when to buy or sell to try to make a profit.</p></li>

					<h3>AI Techniques</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					AI encompasses a variety of techniques and algorithms to enable intelligent behavior in machines. Some common AI techniques include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><h4>Machine Learning:</h4><p>Machine Learning is like teaching computers to learn and make decisions from data, without being explicitly programmed. It's a type of artificial intelligence where computers can automatically improve their performance on tasks through experience. Machine learning is used in things like predicting weather, recommending movies, and detecting spam emails.</p></li>
					<li><h4>Deep Learning:</h4><p>Deep Learning is like teaching computers to learn and understand complex patterns in data by using artificial neural networks that have many layers. It's a type of machine learning that can automatically learn to recognize patterns or make predictions from large amounts of data. Deep learning is used in things like image recognition, speech recognition, and self-driving cars.</p></li>
					<li><h4>Neural Networks:</h4><p>Neural Networks are like computer systems inspired by the human brain's structure and function. They consist of interconnected nodes called neurons that work together to process and analyze information. Neural networks can learn from data, recognize patterns, and make decisions, similar to how the brain works. They're used in tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling</p></li>
					<li><h4>Genetic Algorithms:</h4><p>Genetic Algorithms are like problem-solving strategies inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution. They use techniques inspired by genetics and evolution to find solutions to complex problems. By mimicking the process of natural selection, genetic algorithms evolve potential solutions over multiple generations, gradually improving them to find the best possible solution to a problem. They're used in optimization, search, and machine learning tasks</p></li>
					<li><h4>Expert Systems:</h4><p>Expert Systems are like smart computer programs that mimic the decision-making abilities of human experts in a specific field. They use rules and knowledge derived from experts to solve problems or make decisions. Expert systems can analyze information, provide recommendations, and offer solutions based on their expertise. They're used in areas like medicine, finance, and engineering to assist professionals in their decision-making processes</p></li>
					<li><h4>Reinforcement Learning:</h4><p>Reinforcement Learning is like teaching computers to learn from trial and error to achieve a goal. It's a type of machine learning where computers learn to make decisions by receiving feedback on their actions. When they do something right, they get rewarded, and when they do something wrong, they learn from it. Reinforcement learning is used in things like training robots to navigate environments, play games, and optimize processes</p></li>
					<li><h4>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</h4><p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that teaches computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
